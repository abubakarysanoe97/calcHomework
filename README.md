-prep code: a form of pseudcode to help to help you focus on the logic and not stress the syntax
test code: a class or method that'll test the real code and make sure is doing the right thing
real code: the actual implementation of the code

*Java API
Java already has hundreds of pre bult classes
* arraylisit to make array and add value to it after
* can remove objects from the arraylist
* an array has to know it size when created an array list dosent
* to put thing in a regular array you must asaign it to a location

  You have to know the full name of the class you want use in your code
  you can import a arraylist

  *Plan your program with the future in mind

  * Inheritance
    - when you design with inheritance you put common code within a class
    - subclass extands the superclass
    - instance varibles are not overriden
    - if class b extands class a then class b Is-A class a
    - inheritance is works only in one direction
    - helps you avoid duplicated codes
